# hello-world-website
(2022) LHD:Build day 1 website design mockup challenge

The goal of this challenge was to design a website using a tri-chrome scheme. I initially tried using pastel shades of pink, yellow, and blue before concluding that I had created a visual disaster. While not necessarily tri-chrome, the website now has a blue-centric scheme with accents of white.
In regards to the contents of the website, there were no specifics given for this challenge. However, the viewer can look at the website as a representation of every coder's journey. I believe that I can safely assume every coder's journey begins with the greeting "hello world". From "hello world", every coder takes his/her/their own path on the journey. And as with everything to do with the future, the end of the journey isn't necessarily clear.
